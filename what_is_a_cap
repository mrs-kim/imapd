A "cap" is what you get when you can't avoid pleading guilty and you want a chance to earn yourself a lesser sentence. You end up on a cap because your lawyer made you look like a remorseful human to the judge, and the judge saw some potential in you. You say you're guilty, then you're sent back into the world to prove that you'll make good choices when thrown back into your old element.

Many, many people fail their caps, and that's not something you want to do. You're better off not getting your cap in the first place and going straight to jail, than going on a cap and failing. 

The reason why is because the terms are the caps are this: if you plead guilty, you're let out and you're observed for a period of three to six months. You commit to reporting to the judge for that long period of time, during which you're not allowed to do many of the things that you used to do, and which many of the people around you will continue to do while you're on your cap. If you break the rules and make any mistake, you're hauled back into court, and sentenced to jail based not only on your original crime, but also on the fact that you've broken an additional promise to the judge who stuck his kneck out to give you a second chance.
